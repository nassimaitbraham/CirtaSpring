<p>The cat (Felis catus), also known as the domestic cat or housecat[5] to distinguish it from other felines
 and felids, is a small furry domesticated carnivorous mammal that is valued by humans for its companionship
  and for its ability to hunt vermin and household pests. Cats have been associated with humans for 
  at least 9,500 years,[6] and are currently the most popular pet in the world.[7] Owing to their close
   association with humans, cats are now found almost everywhere on Earth.</p>
