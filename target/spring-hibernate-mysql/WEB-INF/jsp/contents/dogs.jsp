<p>The dog (Canis lupus familiaris[1]) is a domesticated form of the grey/gray wolf, a member of the Canidae 
family of the order Carnivora. The term is used for both feral and pet varieties. The domestic dog has been 
the most widely kept working, hunting and companion animal in human history. The word "dog" may also 
mean the male of a canine species,[2] as opposed to the word "bitch" for the female of the species.[3]</p>
